**go-marvel** is a [Go](https://golang.org) client library for the [Marvel REST API](https://developer.marvel.com/)

See [`example/main.go`](https://github.com/ImJasonH/go-marvel/blob/master/example/main.go), which downloads all issue covers of a series, by series ID (default is "Uncanny X-Men"), and constructs a GIF image of them in order.
