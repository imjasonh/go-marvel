**go-marvel** is a [Go](https://golang.org) client library for the [Marvel REST API](https://developer.marvel.com/)

See
[`example/main.go`](https://github.com/imjasonh/go-marvel/blob/master/example/main.go),
which downloads all issue covers of a series, by series ID (default is "Uncanny
X-Men"), and constructs a GIF image of them in order.
